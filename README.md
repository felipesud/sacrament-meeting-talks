**System for creating sacrament meeting speech invitations**

Disclaimer: This software, while created for church use, is not an official system of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and therefore should not be treated, used, or referred to as such.

A simple system to solve a recurring problem for members of the Caçapava Ward bishopric, where they had an organized spreadsheet to create the invitations and store the dates and speakers who have already spoken.

This system comes to solve the problem, it is able to register new speakers, create a new invitation, and after that store it in the database for further research.

It is possible to filter by dates which speakers have spoken and also know how many speeches the speaker has already given within a period of time. This helps organize and better distribute speaking opportunities to all ward members.

A system created with:

- Front End – HTML, CSS, ReactJs
- Back End – Python, Django, and MongoDB

Project in progress...
